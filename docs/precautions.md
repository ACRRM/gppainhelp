title: Precautions When Using Opioids
---
## Gastrointestinal

Use opioids with caution in patients with ileus; consider parenteral route of administration as oral absorption may be minimal.. Use with caution after biliary surgery or in patients with biliary colic; opioids may cause spasm of sphincter of Oddi.

## Respiratory

Use opioids with extreme caution in patients with respiratory depression, severe obstructive airways disease, at risk of upper airways obstruction (e.g. sleep apnoea), or decreased respiratory reserve as they may depress respiration, decrease the cough reflex and dry secretions. However, morphine can be used to manage or control some forms of dyspnoea.

## Renal

Because active/toxic metabolites accumulate in renal impairment, avoid use of codeine, dextropropoxyphene and pethidine; use hydromorphone, morphine and tramadol with caution. Adjust dose or use an alternative opioid, such as fentanyl or buprenorphine.

## Hepatic

Dose adjustment may be required in hepatic impairment.Avoid oxycodone/naloxone combination drugs (Targin) as naloxone will not be metabolised. 

## Elderly

Opioid dose requirement decreases progressively with age. There is an increased risk of adverse effects including cognitive impairment, sedation, respiratory depression and falls. Use a lower initial dose and titrate to effect.

## Children

Opioid use in children is usually initiated or recommended by specialists.

Neonates and children up to approximately 12 months are more susceptible to respiratory depression associated with opioid use. Start with a low dose and titrate to effect.

## Pregnancy

Opioid analgesics may cause respiratory depression in the newborn; withdrawal effects may occur in neonates of dependent mothers. 

## Breastfeeding

Safe to use occasional doses of opioids but avoid codeine. Use repeated doses with caution, especially if infant is premature or <4 weeks old; monitor infant for sedation and other adverse effects.

## Uncorrected endocrine abnormalities

Hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, alcoholism, myasthenia gravis, CNS depression—careful dose titration required.

## Epilepsy or a recognised risk for seizure

e.g. head injury, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections—may increase risk of seizure.

## Hypotension, shock

Reduced blood volume increases hypotensive risk and increases risk of respiratory depression; also impairs IM/SC absorption; careful titration of opioid dose required.
