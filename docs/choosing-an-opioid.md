There is no evidence that any one opioid is significantly more efficacious or less toxic than any other at an equianalgesic dose. **The choice of opioid depends on a number of factors:**

## Ability to swallow:

oral route is preferred; if unable to swallow or compromised GI tract consider transdermal route (e.g. fentanyl patch, buprenorphine patch) or parenteral route (most commonly subcutaneous).

## Impaired renal function:

avoid morphine (can be used at lower doses, less frequently), caution with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Recommended opioids are fentanyl, buprenorphine or methadone.

## Impaired liver function:

caution with oxycodone/naloxone controlled release preparations

## Allergies/intolerance:

rare, often reflects previous adverse event (e.g. nausea and vomiting following post-op opioids). If true allergy, rotate to opioid of different class (see classification).

## Constipation/ileus/bowel obstruction:

slowing of bowel transit time is a common feature of all opioids. Lipophilic opioids (fentanyl, buprenorphine) may be less constipating. Consider combination preparation of oxycodone and naloxone (Targin®), or parenteral formulations.

## Age:

morphine may be less well tolerated in the elderly (probably as a reflection of impaired renal function). Buprenorphine patches (Norspan®) give a continuous infusion of low-dose opioid.

## Cognitive function:

consider once daily formulations or tablets/capsules that can be delivered in Webster packs where cognitive function is impaired.

## Compliance:

consider transdermal preparations for improved compliance.

## Cost:

not all opioids are subsidised by the PBS.

## Availability:

some countries impose strict limitations on availability of opioids.

## Experience:

use a limited number of opioids and become familiar with their use; patients with difficult pain should be referred to palliative care or pain specialists.
