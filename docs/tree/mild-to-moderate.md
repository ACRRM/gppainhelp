title: Mild to Moderate Pain
---
Mild to moderate pain is most commonly controlled by paracetamol and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Paracetamol dose

500-1000mg every 4-6 hours to a maximum of 4g daily.

### NSAIDs

Appropriate for mild to moderate pain related to inflammation, tissue injury, and metastatic bone pain.

### Adverse effects of NSAIDs

* Gastrointestinal toxicity
* Cardiovascular toxicity

Patients taking NSAIDs should have their cardiovascular risks closely monitored and actively managed. See Therapeutic Guidelines: Cardiovascular for further information.

Patients needing low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection should continue to take it even if needing NSAIDs; they should be monitored for GI adverse effects.

Separation in time of dose is advised where NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may interfere with effect of low dose aspirin on platelets.

* Renal toxicity

All NSAIDs can cause renal impairment. Renal toxicity is no less with COX-2-selective inhibitors.
