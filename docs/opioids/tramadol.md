Moderate pain (includes fixed-dose combination with paracetamol).
Acute or chronic pain

## Adverse effects

See full list of Adverse Effects for opioid analgesics.

Specific to Tramadol

* CNS stimulation, weakness, sweating, sleep disorder, rash
* Depression, difficulty in concentration

## Dose

### IV/IM

* 50–100 mg every 4–6 hours, up to a total daily dose of 600 mg (maximum 300 mg daily if >75 years). 
* Nausea and vomiting are more likely with IV bolus doses >50 mg

### Oral-immediate release

* 50–100 mg every 4–6 hours when necessary; maximum 400 mg daily (or 300 mg daily if >75 years).

### Oral-12 hour controlled release

* 50–200 mg every 12 hours; maximum 400 mg daily (or 300 mg daily if >75 years). Do not use controlled release product for initial stabilisation.

### Oral-24 hour controlled release

* Start with 100 mg once daily; usual dose 200 mg once daily (maximum 400 mg once daily). Do not use controlled release product for initial stabilisation.

### Renal impairment

* IV/IM/oral (immediate release product), initially 50–100 mg every 12 hours.
* Oral (12 hour controlled release product), initially 50–200 mg every 24 hours.

### Severe hepatic impairment

* IV/IM/oral (immediate release product), 50-100 mg every 12 hours.

### Fixed-dose combination with paracetamol

* For adult, initially 2 tablets (of paracetamol 325mg and tramadol 37.5 mg), then 1 to 2 tablets every 6 hours if needed. Maximum of 8 tablets in 24 hours

## Administration advice

* Give IV injection over 2 to 3 minutes; nausea and vomiting are more likely after rapid injection.

## Counselling

* Swallow whole; do not crush or chew controlled release tablets

## Precautions

### Serotonin toxicity

* Treatment with, or within 14 days of, a MAOI is contraindicated due to risk of serotonin toxicity.
* Treatment with other drugs that may contribute to serotonin toxicity may increase likelihood; avoid combinations or monitor clinical course carefully.

### Renal

* Rate of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite are decreased in renal impairment. Avoid if CrCl <10 mL/minute; reduce dose if CrCl <30 mL/minute (24 hour controlled release product is contraindicated in this situation).

### Hepatic

* In severe hepatic impairment reduce the dose of parenteral and immediate release oral products; do not use controlled release products.

### Elderly

* Avoid use in people >75 years; do not use 24 hour controlled release product.

### Children

* Limited data available. Although the manufacturer does not recommend use in children, it is used by some specialist paediatricians.

## Practice considerations

* analgesia starts within 1 hour of oral administration, peaks at 2–4 hours
* do not use controlled release products for acute pain management as slow onset and offset make rapid, safe titration impossible
* 6–10% of Caucasians and 1–2% of Asians lack the enzyme CYP2D6 (necessary for metabolism of tramadol to the active metabolite O‑desmethyltramadol); these people may obtain reduced analgesia with tramadol
* if maximum doses are not fully effective, consider alternative opioid (e.g. morphine) and/or seek specialist advice
* tramadol has relatively weak affinity for opioid receptors and the misuse potential appears to be low; it is designated as a Schedule 4 product and not a controlled substance
* atypical withdrawal symptoms (e.g. severe anxiety, panic attacks, hallucinations, paraesthesia, tinnitus) have been reported
* naloxone only partially antagonises tramadol overdose, and may increase the risk of seizures

## Practice considerations (for fixed-dose combination with paracetamol)

* Consider using paracetamol and tramadol separately to optimise analgesia, because the maximum recommended dosage of the fixed dose combination is only 2.6 g paracetamol and 300 mg tramadol daily
