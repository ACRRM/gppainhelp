### Fixed-dose combination with aspirin

* 1–2 tablets every 4 hours if needed, up to a maximum of 8 tablets daily.

### Fixed-dose combination with ibuprofen

* 1–2 tablets (of ibuprofen 200 mg and codeine 12.8 mg) every 4 hours if needed, up to a maximum of 6 tablets daily.

### Fixed-dose combination with paracetamol

* 1–2 tablets (of paracetamol 500 mg and codeine 8, 15 or 30 mg) every 4–6 hours if needed, up to a maximum of 8 tablets daily.

## Practice considerations

* codeine is not recommended for the management of severe pain
* codeine (a prodrug) is metabolised to morphine; people with normal codeine metabolism metabolise 30 mg of codeine to approximately 4.5 mg of morphine
* codeine is metabolised by CYP2D6:

  * some people are unlikely to obtain analgesia with codeine due to a genetic lack of CYP2D6, e.g. 6–10% of Caucasians and 1–2% of Asians
  * some people are ultra-rapid metabolisers, e.g. up to 10% of Caucasians, 1–2% of Asians and 29% of Ethiopians, and may achieve higher morphine concentrations, increasing their risk of toxicity
* beware of the potential for misuse leading to dependence and over-use of OTC codeine fixed-dose combinations; this has resulted in toxicity from the non-opioid analgesic, e.g. acute renal failure and GI perforation from ibuprofen
* there is no conclusive evidence that products containing 8–15 mg of codeine per tablet with paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen have any benefits over these non-opioids alone
