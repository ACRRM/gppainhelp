## Indications

* Moderate to severe pain

## Adverse effects

See Adverse effects

## Starting dose

### **Acute pain**

**S/C**

* 2.5-5 mg every 2 hours

### Oral

* Do not use controlled release tablets for treatment of acute pain, see practice considerations.
* Immediate release oral product, initially 2.5–5 mg every 4 hours (start with 2.5 mg in those >70 years); titrate dose according to response and sedation score, see [respiratory depression](<https://gppainhelp.netlify.app/content/precautions#respiratory >). More frequent administration and/or higher doses may be required for severe acute pain.

### Chronic cancer pain

* Initial dosing

  * Immediate release oral product, 2.5–5 mg every 4 hours in opioid-naive patients. If previously on opioids, consider equianalgesic dose of oxycodone (see [Opioid Comparative Information Table](https://gppainhelp.netlify.app/content/opioid-comparative-information-table)). Do not use controlled release tablet for initial stabilisation.
  * Titrate doses to effect, and when stable calculate 24‑hour oxycodone requirement for maintenance dosing.
* Maintenance dosing

  * Oral controlled release tablet, total daily dose as determined for conventional product; give up to half total daily dose every 12 hours. Titrate dose depending on response.
  * SC infusion, calculate the 24‑hour oral dose of oxycodone and give half this amount by SC infusion over a 24‑hour period. Titrate dose depending on response.

### Chronic non-cancer pain (adult)

* Involve a specialist pain team in assessing and managing the patient.
* Avoid opioid analgesia if at all possible; maximise non-opioid analgesia and non-pharmacological therapies. 

### Changing route

* Parenteral/oral, the variability of oxycodone's oral bioavailability (approximately 50–90%) requires the initial conversion to be conservative; titrate subsequent doses according to response:

  * IV/SC to oral, assume 1 mg IV/SC = 1 mg oral.
  * oral to IV/SC, assume 2 mg oral = 1 mg IV/SC.

### Changing opioid

* 15–20 mg oral oxycodone is approximately equianalgesic to 20–40 mg oral morphine or 10 mg SC morphine. When changing drugs, start at lower than the calculated equianalgesic dose and titrate to response.

## Counselling

* Do not break, crush or chew controlled release tablets, swallow whole tablet

## Precautions

### Renal

* Although renal impairment does not result in significant accumulation of active metabolites, the concentration of oxycodone may increase. Reduce initial dose if CrCl < 30mL/minute.

### Hepatic

* Avoid in severe hepatic impairment. Avoid fixed-dose combination with naloxone in any patient with liver impairment.

## Practice considerations

* oxycodone may be tried as an alternative opioid for patients intolerant of morphine
* do not use controlled release tablets for acute pain as slow onset and offset make rapid, safe titration impossible
* suppositories have slower onset and longer effect than conventional tablets; they may be useful for patients unable to swallow

## Fixed-dose combination with naloxone (Targin®)

* naloxone is intended to reduce opioid-induced GI adverse effects such as constipation; will only relieve opioid induced constipation
* naloxone will not be metabolised in patients with liver impairment thus negating the analgesic effect of the oxycodone; contraindicated even in mild liver impairment
