## Indications

* Moderate to severe pain
* Acute or chronic pain

## Adverse effects

See Adverse effects

## Dose

Doses will vary widely depending on the indication, e.g. acute or chronic pain, and previous analgesic requirements. In acute pain and palliative care there is no maximum dose; adverse effects and tolerance limit the morphine dose.

Titrate dose according to response and any adverse effect. Monitor for respiratory depression and sedation, using a sedation score.

### Acute Pain

### IV

* Initially, 0.5–2 mg; repeat every 10 minutes and titrate. This interval may not represent the true time to peak effect (which may be up to 15 minutes). Use the lower dose in patients >70 years of age.

### SC/IM

* initially 2.5–5 mg every 3-4 hours.
* Use lower doses at prolonged intervals in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment.

### Oral

* Do not use controlled release products for the initial treatment of acute pain
* Immediate release oral product: initially 5–10 mg every 4 hours (start with 5 mg in patients >70 years).
* More frequent dosing and/or higher doses may be required for severe acute pain; refer to local hospital protocols

### Chronic cancer pain: adult

* Initial dosing; 

  * Use oral liquid or immediate release oral tablets and give dose every 4 hours.
  * If opioid-naïve; start with 2.5–5 mg (use lower dose in elderly patients)
  * If previously on opioids; consider equianalgesic dose of morphine
* This dose can also be given for breakthrough pain as often as required (up to hourly)
* Titrate doses to effect, and when stable calculate 24-hour morphine requirement for maintenance dosing

### Maintenance dosing

* Convert the 24-hour dose of immediate release preparation into an equivalent dose of a controlled release product for maintenance treatment
* 12 hourly oral controlled release tablets (e.g. MS Contin, Momex SR). Total daily dose as determined by immediate release titration, but give half total daily dose every 12 hours.
* **OR** 24 hourly oral controlled release capsules (e.g. Kapanol, MS Mono). Total daily dose as determined by immediate release titration given every 24 hours. 
* SC infusion

  * Calculate 24‑hour oral dose of morphine and give one-third by SC infusion over 24 hours.

### Breakthrough pain

Use additional doses of morphine oral liquid or immediate release tablets for breakthrough pain, giving one-sixth of the daily requirement as frequently as required. If repeated breakthrough doses are required, adjust the regular baseline morphine dose.

### Chronic non-cancer pain: adult

* Involve a specialist pain team in assessing and managing the patient
* Maximise use of co-analgesics, adjuvants and non-pharmacological methods of pain control
* Avoid opioids if at all possible.

## Dose equivalences

* For chronic dosing, 30 mg oral morphine is equivalent to 10 mg SC/IV morphine
* Use the same dose for sulphate, tartrate and hydrochloride salts
* For equivalent doses of other opioids, see [Opioid Comparative Information Table](https://gppainhelp.netlify.app/content/opioid-comparative-information-table)

## Administration advice

* For IV use, dilute and give over 4 to 5 minutes
* Compatible fluids: sodium chloride 0.9%, glucose 5%, sodium chloride 0.18% with glucose 4%
* Controlled release capsules (Kapanol, MS Mono) may be opened, the pellets mixed with 10 – 20 mL of water or liquid feed, and given through a 16 or 20 gauge French gastrostomy tube, then rinsed through with more liquid to ensure all pellets are used. Do not crush pellets.

## Patient advice

* Controlled release tablets (e.g. MS Contin®, Momex SR®) must be swallowed whole; do not crush or chew them.
* Controlled release capsules (Kapanol®, MS Mono®) may be opened, and the pellets sprinkled on soft food or mixed with 30 mL liquid. Take within 30 minutes for Kapanol® or 60 minutes for MS Mono®. Do not crush or chew pellets.
* Do not take morphine with alcohol as it may affect the release of morphine from the capsules and increase the likelihood of side effects.

## Precautions

### Renal

* Morphine’s active metabolites accumulate in renal impairment and have a longer half-life than morphine; may cause respiratory depression and delirium. Use an alternative opioid (or reduce dose if CrCl <50 mL/minute and use with caution).
* Avoid chronic use if CrCl <10 mL/minute, due to accumulation of active metabolites.

### Hepatic

* Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment where it may cause excessive sedation.

## Practice considerations

* Peak analgesia following a dose of morphine occurs within:

  * 60 minutes after oral liquid
  * 50–90 minutes after SC injection (30–60 minutes after IM)
  * 20 minutes after IV injection
* do not use controlled release products for acute pain management as slow onset and offset make rapid, safe titration impossible
* reassess the patient’s pain frequently and adjust morphine dose accordingly
* respiratory depression after intrathecal morphine may have a delayed onset and prolonged duration; continue monitoring for 18–24 hours after administration
