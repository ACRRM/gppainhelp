## Indications

* Severe chronic pain
* Management of opioid dependence

## Adverse effects

Following adverse effects are specific to Methadone. See full list of adverse effects from opioid analgesics.

### Common

Pain and swelling may occur at injection site

### Rare

* Prolonged QT interval
* Torsades de pointes (with high doses)

## Dose

* Consult a chronic pain specialist or a pain management clinic. Dose titration must be very cautious in view of its long half-life. It may take up to 2 weeks to see adverse effects.

## Patient advice

* See Patient advice

## Precautions

Suggest specialist use only

### Cardiac

* Risk factors for prolonged QT interval; in high doses, methadone may prolong the QT interval and increase risk of arrhythmia. Avoid use if risk factors cannot be corrected.

### Renal

* Safe in patients with renal impairment.

### Hepatic

* Avoid use in severe impairment; increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Lower doses required in hepatic impairment.

### Elderly

* Use with extreme caution; seek specialist advice.

## Practice considerations

* Not suitable for acute pain management as the long half-life makes rapid, safe titration difficult
* Other opioids are preferred for severe chronic pain; methadone may be useful in patients who have inadequate pain relief or intolerable adverse effects with other opioids; use cautiously
* Methadone has high oral bioavailability, but a long and variable duration of effect in chronic use makes dose adjustment difficult
