## Changing opioid

If the adverse effects of an opioid become intolerable, switching to an alternative opioid may help. When changing drugs, consider equianalgesic doses. Start at less than the dose indicated in the opioid comparative information table as there may be incomplete cross-tolerance between opioids. Monitor closely and titrate dose depending on assessment of pain control. Use breakthrough doses of opioid, if required, to establish adequate analgesia. 

## Changing administration route, same opioid

Changing the route of administration, e.g to subcutaneous infusion, may improve analgesia.
