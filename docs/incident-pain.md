title: Incident Pain
---
Incident pain is exacerbated by, or occurs with, activity, such as getting out of bed. It is common in patients with metastatic bone disease.

Consideration should be given to palliative radiotherapy, and where relevant, orthopaedic surgery to pre-empt or stabilise a fracture.

Options for management of incident pain

* Adequate doses of an NSAID
* Short acting opioids such as fentanyl
* Other short acting agents e.g. nitrous oxide
* Seek input of a physiotherapist or occupational therapist to help activity
